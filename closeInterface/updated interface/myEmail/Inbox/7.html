                            <pre>Dear CFD Global;

I would like to cancel my account and withdraw all funds that I have
deposited. Since my account is not verified, this should be possible
without additional fees being charged. I was promised a 1-1 consultation
yesterday but this did not happen and there was no contact to inform me of
it being cancelled. I just want my money back.

Regards;
Shivaan
